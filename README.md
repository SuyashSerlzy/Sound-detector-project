# Sound-detector-project
This program runs on Serial plotter from Arduino ide.
GO to tools section in Arduino ide and select serial plotter and it will run, but before that write the code which is in soundsensor.cpp file up in the code section.
Take 3 jumper wires and follow me.
You need to connect sound sensor's ground pin (GND) to Uno's any ground pin.
Connect 5v pin of the sensor to Uno's 5v, VIN or 3.3v pin.
Connect sensor's OUT pin to Uno's any Analog pin or Digital pin.
And if you are done then compile it and make noise near the sensor the plotter should show some difference but it will not always accurate to make it more accurate then rotate the potentiometer and it will be slighty more accurate and you can make it better by looking at some youtube videos but this is just a simple verson of it.
