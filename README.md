# Sound-detector-project
This program runs on Serial plotter from Arduino ide.
GO to tools section in Arduino ide and select serial plotter and it will run, but before that write the code which is in soundsensor.cpp file up in the code section.
Take 3 jumper wires and follow me.
You need to connect sound sensor's ground pin (GND) to Uno's any ground pin.
Connect 5v pin of the sensor to Uno's 5v, VIN or 3.3v pin.
Connect sensor's OUT pin to Uno's any Analog pin or Digital pin.
